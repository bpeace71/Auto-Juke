<h3>//Project Description//</h3>
<p>Amazargemart (Ah-muh-zahr-geh-mart) is a single-destination browser-based price comparison tool comparing lowest possible prices of an item offered by Amazon, Target, and Walmart.  Amazargemart aims to be minimalist and easy for the user to access.</p>

<h3>//Sketch of Final Product//</h3>
<p>Amazargemart is a single-page utility, with a search bar for input of the item the user wishes to price-check.  Prices for the item will be listed from lowest to highest along with their respective sources in a separate object.</p>

<h3>//APIs to be Used//</h3>
<p>Amazon, Target, and Walmart all have public APIs that allow for item search, and as such all three will be integrated into Amazargemart's functionality.</p>
